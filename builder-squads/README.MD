## Squad Structure and Onboarding:


### Squad Point of Contact 
Scott Stevenson will be the point of contact for this work conducted by W3C:



Squads are groups of builders who tackle one goal together.

Builders can participate in as many squads as they want.

## New Squad Member Onboarding Step-by-Step 

### Step 1.  
Fill out this online form questionnaire . [Onboard Form](https://github.com/Web3-API)

### Step 2.
Select a squad from the form drop-down list.  You can freely leave a squad, start a new one or become and individual contributor. Some subcontractors may be considered individual contributors or be treated as buinesses.

### Step 3. 
Find the squad point-of-contact. This will be you main guide and main liason with the larger DAO. This contact will make your transition into the DAO a smooth one and you will be able to contributute and start earning right away. 

### Step 4. 
Affitmatively reach out to squad point of contact. This is the first step in onboarding, and once you do you will be guided into the working Web3API ecosystem. They are well versed in the next steps. 

### Step 5. 
Go visit the coordination calendar so you can see what we are working on today.

This completes your initial orientation (for today).  

### Step 5.  
Track the calendar and reach out to squad point of content if you have questions about reaching the objectives. Squad point-of-contact will update you with meetings, objectives and working goals. 

Each squad keeps its own channels of communications.

Functionally, the squad is responsible for housing their own content as things progress. The more succinct the milestones are the better for there to be a way to get the voting-block to approve the milestone payments.

This allows for larger bankroll of a squad based initiative to succeeed. It allow the squad to "oil its own machine" under the umbrella and over-arching upper intives upper objectives.
  
### Interal squad recruiting method.
Recruit from within to best use the skill sets and contribution level.

Each squad may have an special andlge or philsophy, sense of humor etc.  A squad may be large or small. But each squad should not exceed 7 members for it becomes dificult to determine work/split accounting and is unecessary management challenge.

## Squad member recruiting.

#### We have 3 levels of current Web3API participants.

1. Joined through tokens - OG Core 10 people 
2. Telegram (not token holders but want to build)
3. Pure-Subcontractor


#### We aim to move some subcontractor relationships to squad participation.
* Gitcoin contributors are a source
* Common inquiries from media responses is a source.
* Our existing DAO and their circle of influence s a source.


### Squad Payments 
Proposals are invoiced to a proxy smart-contract that has prorated splits decided on by the squads themselves. Each squads decides on their own split so not to burden parent DAO Web3API into splits of divided work over the work period, much like a traditional contractor/subcontractor relationship. 

Each squad may adjusting splits on a rolling 30/60-day to cover for shortfalls or other squad members over/under perfomrance.  Recalculations are maintained by each squad within the original approved proposal, and squads may be paid via with proxy smart-contract upon final work delivery and invoice submission. It allows the squads to self-govern their participation.   

------------------ 

### Follow these steps to squad. 
[Find Squad Contact Person](https://github/Web3-API/dao/builder-squads/builders/buildername.md)

1. Each new squad member needs to make a basic profile to be in a general directory.

1. The overall scope of the monthly work.
1. A detailed technical description
1. A milestones schedule and time approximation
1. Requested amount and delivery address
1. A biography or portfolio of work
1. A brief description of the current squad

### Guide to a Creating a Squad Proposal and Work Product - Program Roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

    A release phase that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

    A feature area that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

    A feature that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below.

    One or more product SKU labels that indicate which product SKUs we expect the feature to be available in. For a list of current product SKUs, see below.

    One or more deployment models (cloud, server, and/or ae). Where not stated, features will generally come out Cloud first, and follow on Server and GHAE at or soon after GA.

### Release phases

Every product or feature goes through a set of release phases, from early testing to general availability.

    alpha: Primarily for testing and feedback
    Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

    beta: Publicly available in full or limited capacity
    Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

    ga: Generally available to all customers
    Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

### Exploratory stages

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

    in design:
    Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out how.

    exploring:
    Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

### Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. 

GitHub Enterprise Server has major releases on a quarterly basis, and minor releases on a monthly basis. Once we know what version we are delivering a feature, we will update the issue to indicate that information.

    code: Code experiences (Repositories, Pull Requests, Gists)
