### Step 3. 
Affitmatively reach out to squad point of contact. This is the first step in onboarding, and once you do you will be guided into the working Web3API ecosystem. They are well versed in the next steps. 

### Step 4.

### Step 5.  
Track the calendar and reach out to squad point of content if you have questions about reaching the objectives. Squad point-of-contact will update you with meetings, objectives and working goals. Each squad keeps its own channels of communications.

Functionally, the squad is responsible for housing their own content as things progress. The more succinct the milestones are the better for there to be a way to get the voting-block to approve the milestone payments.This allows for larger bankroll of a squad based initiative to succeeed. It allow the squad to "oil its own machine" under the umbrella and over-arching upper intives upper objectives.

### Squad Payments 
Proposals are invoiced to a proxy smart-contract that has prorated splits decided on by the squads themselves. Each squads decides on their own split so not to burden parent DAO Web3API into splits of divided work over the work period, much like a traditional contractor/subcontractor relationship. 

Each squad may adjusting splits on a rolling 30/60-day to cover for shortfalls or other squad members over/under perfomrance.  Recalculations are maintained by each squad within the original approved proposal, and squads may be paid via with proxy smart-contract upon final work delivery and invoice submission. It allows the squads to self-govern their participation.
