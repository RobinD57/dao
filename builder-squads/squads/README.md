# Squads

Squads are groups of builders who tackle one goal together. Builders can participate in as many squads as they want.

You can see a list of existing squads in the [squads directory](#Squads-Directory)

# What to know about the Squad system

Squads are formed to coordinate efforts towards specific milestones on the [Web3API public roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap).
