# Squads

Squads are groups of builders who tackle together [milestones from the Web3API public roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap). Builders can participate in as many squads as they want. You can contact or join any of the existing squads in the [squads directory](#Squads-Directory)

# Joining a squad

The people on the [squads directory](#Squads-Directory) have listed themselves voluntarily as points of contact. Reach out to the squads that you find interesting and ask them how to help.

# Creating a new squad

Feel free to create a new squad with other builders to tackle objectives together. 

1. Make sure you fully understand the [DAO Readme.md](../README.md) and the [Contribution Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTE.md)

1. Make sure you have already been added to the [builder profiles](../builders/README.md)

1. Fork [web3-api/dao](https://github.com/web3-api/dao)'s `master` branch'.

1. Duplicate the [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md) file in the [`./squads`](./squads) folder.

1. Give a name to the squad, complete all required fields, and feel free to get creative with anything else you'd like to add.

1. Open a PR against [web3-api/dao](https://github.com/web3-api/dao)'s `master` branch to merge your new squad.

Remember that each squad is responsible of keeping updated the info on their profile.
