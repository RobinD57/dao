# How to create work proposals

1. Make sure you fully understand the [DAO Readme.md](../readme.md) and the [Contribution Guidelines](../contribute.md)

1. Consider an item from the [Web3API public roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap) you want to tackle.

1. Fork [web3-api/dao](https://github.com/web3-api/dao)'s `master` branch'.

1. Duplicate the [`000-TEMPLATE.md`](./spending-proposals/000-TEMPLATE.md) file in the [`./spending-proposals`](./spending-proposals) folder.

1. Name the file using the number of the roadmapissue, complete all required fields, and feel free to get creative with anything else you'd like to add.

1. Gather feedback on your work proposal from [existing collaborators](../builder-squads/squads/readme.md) and make necessary edits. Remember to:
   - Sharing your proposal on community channels
   - Modify the spending proposal to achieve concensus

4. Open a PR against [web3-api/dao](https://github.com/web3-api/dao)'s `master` branch to merge your work proposal.
5. Create a proposal in the [DAO's snapshot space](https://snapshot.page/#/web3-api), linking to the open PR.

6. If the DAO proposal passes, the PR with the spending proposal can then be merged into master.

1. Consider adding your builder profile using the [builder profile template](../builder-squads/builders/TEMPLATE.md)

1. When the work is finished, update your Work Proposal with a list of deliverables that demonstrate your work.
