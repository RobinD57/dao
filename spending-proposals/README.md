# How to create work proposals

1. Before you start make sure you fully understand the [DAO Readme.md](../readme.md) and the [Contribution Guidelines](../contribute.md)
1. Consider an item from the [Web3API public roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap) you want to tackle.
1. Fork and edit [this template](./000-TEMPLATE.md) to describe how you plan to tackle the item.
1. Gather feedback from [existing collaborators](../builder-squads/squads/readme.md) iterate, by:
   - Sharing your proposal on community channels
   - Modify the spending proposal to achieve concensus
1. Submit a Pull request to merge your work proposal (this is not binding)
1. Post a proposal through [snapshot](#linktosnapshothere) and wait for DAO vote.
1. When the work is finished, update your Work Proposal with a list of deliverables that demonstrate your work.
1. Share this PR with the DAO and Submit a proposal to the Aragon DAo to receive the benefits listed in the work proposal.


# Getting started 

1. Fork [web3-api/dao](https://github.com/web3-api/dao)'s `master` branch'.
2. Duplicate the [`TEMPLATE.md`](./spending-proposals/TEMPLATE.md) file in the [`./spending-proposals`](./spending-proposals) folder.
3. Name the file, complete all required fields, and feel free to get creative with anything else you'd like to add.
4. Open a PR against [web3-api/dao](https://github.com/web3-api/dao)'s `master` branch.
5. Create a proposal in the [DAO's snapshot space](https://snapshot.page/#/web3-api), linking to the open PR.
6. If the DAO proposal passes, the PR can then be merged into master.
