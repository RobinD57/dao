<img src="./img/token-distribution.png" width="300px"/>

#### Pre-Seed Builders
At launch 4,000 `W3API` were minted to *Pre-Seed Builders* in proportion to work contributed before launch on October 1st 2020 (viewable [here](./token-allocations/pre-seed-builders.csv)).

#### Pre-Seed Funders
4,000 `W3API` were minted to *Pre-Seed Funders*, with a goal of raising $1M to sustain the project. Tokens were distributed in three batches (viewable [here](./token-allocations/pre-seed-funders.csv))

#### Builders
12,000 `W3API` will be minted to *Builders* in proportion to value-added contributions over the first 16 months (~750/month). `W3API` holders will decide on further fundraising and token emission plans after the 16 month pre-seed period.


## FAQ

**What can I do with my `W3API` tokens?**  
Once your token request is approved, you instantly have the power to vote on all on-chain decisions, such as spending funds or minting new tokens.

**What about vesting?**  
`W3API` tokens are initially set to be non-transferable. The DAO can decide to change this in the future and mint tokens to contributors via timelock or vesting contracts.
