The Web3API DAO is responsible for stewarding the Web3API ecosystem. `W3API` governance token holders will have immediate control of the:
- [Web3API public proadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap)
- [DAO Treasury](https://client.aragon.org/#/w3api/0x8fe59d8fb5ffd3509e5cb3d386be8bdb2d363662/)
- [`W3API` token issuance](./token.md)
- [DAO configuration](#dao-configuration)
- ENS domains (web3api.eth & web3hub.eth)


In the future, it is anticipated that the DAO will also govern:

- Web3API [repositories](https://github.com/Web3-API)
- Web3Hub platform deployments
- DAO-verified APIs (hosted at web3api.eth subdomains)
