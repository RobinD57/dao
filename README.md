The Web3API DAO is responsible for stewarding the Web3API ecosystem. `W3API` governance token holders will have immediate control of the:
- Web3API [roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap)
- [Treasury](https://client.aragon.org/#/w3api/0x8fe59d8fb5ffd3509e5cb3d386be8bdb2d363662/)
- [`W3API` token issuance](#w3api-token)
- [DAO configuration](#dao-configuration)
- ENS domain (web3api.eth)

In the future, it is anticipated that the DAO will also govern:

- Web3API [repositories](https://github.com/Web3-API)
- Web3Hub platform deployments
- DAO-verified APIs (hosted at web3api.eth subdomains)

# FAQ

### What are the benefits of being a builder?

*Builders* are granted funds and `W3API` tokens on a per-project basis by the Web3API DAO. Projects are approved ahead of time to help manage the DAO budget, maintain accountability, and schedule developments.

### What is the W3API Token?

The W3API Tokens represent government rights on the Web3API DAO. The tokens are initially set to be non-transferable. Detail on token distribution can be found [here](./token.md)

## How is the Web3API DAO using its funds?

With the goal of delivering the items listed on the [Web3API public roadmap](https://github.com/Web3-API/roadmap), in the first 16 months (Sept 2020 to Dec 2021), it is anticipated that the DAO will allocate funds for:
- Development - $42,000 / month
- Ops & Adoption - $15,000 / month
- Legal & SaaS - $5,500 / month
